# Predictive Modeling of Energy Consumption Per Capita

## Introduction:
As the global community accelerates toward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the disparity in energy consumption patterns across nations remains a critical barrier to equitable growth. This project proposes a data-driven framework to analyze and forecast these patterns. Predictive Modeling for Global Sustainable Energy Demand leverages machine learning to forecast per capita energy consumption based on socio-economic, geographic, and environmental indicators. By identifying the core drivers of energy demand, we provide actionable insights to support SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), ensuring that energy planning is both equitable and efficient. 

## Problems:
1. Global Energy Inequity: Energy consumption is characterized by extreme disparities between developed and developing nations. Without granular, country-specific insights, international bodies struggle to implement effective sustainability policies that account for local infrastructure and wealth gaps.
2. Carbon-Intensive Growth: In many regions, economic advancement is still heavily coupled with high-carbon energy sources. Without accurate predictive modeling, nations miss critical opportunities to optimize their energy mix and transition to low-carbon alternatives during periods of rapid development.

## Obejectives:
1. Develop a Predictive Model: Build a Machine Learning model to accurately forecast the Primary energy consumption per capita of various nations based on environmental and socio-economic features.
2. Inform Sustainable Policy (SDG 7): Identify and analyze the key variables—such as GDP per capita and electricity access—that most significantly impact national energy demands to promote inclusive energy access.

## Deliverables
1. Engineered Sustainable Energy Dataset: A refined and preprocessed global dataset where structural errors, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies have been resolved, providing a clean foundation for multi-national energy trend analysis.
2. Global Energy Forecasting Model: A validated machine learning model trained on temporal data (2000–2017) and tested on future horizons (2018–2020) to ensure reliable demand forecasting across diverse economic regions.
