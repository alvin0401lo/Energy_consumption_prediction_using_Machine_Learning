# Predictive Modeling of Energy Consumption Per Capita
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy

## Introduction:
The world is moving fast toward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but energy use looks very different from one country to the next. This unevenness blocks fair progress. In this project, we use a data-driven approach to examine and predict energy consumption trends among countries. Using machine learning, we forecast per capita energy use based on socio-economic, geographic, and environmental factors. By identifying the core drivers of energy demand, we provide actionable insights to support SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), ensuring that energy planning is equitable and efficient. 

## Problems:
1. **Global Energy Inequity:** Despite global efforts toward the 2030 Agenda, patterns of energy use differ sharply between regions. Where some countries enjoy excess supply, others face persistent shortages. Unequal access emerges not by accident but through structural imbalance. Progress stalls when basic needs go unmet in one area while waste occurs elsewhere. Without examining root causes, fairness remains out of reach. Sustainability cannot take hold where conditions are this lopsided.
2. **Lack of Predictive Foresight:** Looking ahead matters more than reviewing history when advancing SDG 7. Instead of relying on outdated patterns, decision makers need clear projections shaped by reliable data. When forecasts lack strength, plans respond to crises after they occur. Such delays create persistent problems across regions; either there are too little power or unused systems pile up. As a result, progress slows, access gaps widen, essential supplies miss their mark.

## Obejectives:
1. **Develop a Predictive Model:** Build a Machine Learning model to accurately forecast the Primary energy consumption per capita of various nations based on environmental and socio-economic features.
2. **Inform Sustainable Policy (SDG 7):** Identify and analyse the key variables, such as GDP per capita and electricity access, that most significantly impact national energy demands to promote inclusive energy access.

## Deliverables
1. **Engineered Sustainable Energy Dataset:** A refined and preprocessed global dataset where structural errors, outliers, and formatting inconsistencies have been resolved, providing a clean foundation for multinational energy trend analysis and model training.
2. **Global Energy Forecasting Model:** A validated machine learning model to predict energy consumption per capita based on socio-economic and environmental drivers. This model has been evaluated through K-fold cross-validation and independent testing to ensure high accuracy and reliable performance across diverse global regions.
