# Predictive_Modeling_for_EV_Charging_Infrastructure_Optimization

##Introduction:
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates, the uncoordinated charging behavior of users poses significant challenges to grid stability and sustainability. This project proposes a data-driven approach to solve these issues. Predictive Modeling for EV Charging Infrastructure Optimization leverages machine learning to forecast energy demand. We provide actionable insights to balance grid load and align with SDG 7 by incentivizing users to shift charging sessions away from congested evening peak hours. Furthermore, by integrating carbon intensity data, we aim to reduce the carbon footprint of charging sessions, directly contributing to SDG 13.

##Problems:
1. Grid Overload: Charging demand often coincides with residential peak hours (Evening Peaks), forcing grid operators to rely on inefficient, carbon-intensive peaker plants.
2. Carbon Inefficiency: A significant portion of charging occurs during times of high carbon intensity, missing the opportunity to utilize daytime renewable energy (e.g., solar surplus).

##Obejectives:
Develop a Predictive Model: Build a Machine Learning model to accurately forecast the Energy Consumption of individual charging sessions based on environmental and temporal features.Optimize Grid Load (SDG 7): Identify and reduce peak grid stress by guiding users to avoid the most congested evening peaks.Reduce Emissions (SDG 13): Quantify and minimize the carbon footprint by shifting charging loads to low-carbon time windows (e.g., solar peaks).
